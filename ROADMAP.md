## üöÄ STARTUP PRESENTATION POINTS

After completing Phase 1, you'll be able to say:

_"I built a full-stack barber booking platform from scratch using the MERN stack. It features real-time queue management, role-based authentication, and QR code check-ins. The app solves the real problem of waiting in barber shop queues by allowing customers to book slots and see live wait times."_

## üìû NEXT SESSION AGENDA

1. **Implement Login/Register Forms** (30 mins)
2. **Connect Frontend to Backend APIs** (45 mins)
3. **Create Basic Shop Listing** (30 mins)
4. **Test Authentication Flow** (15 mins)

**Remember**: This is your startup project, not just a coding exercise. Think like a founder:

- Solve real problems
- Focus on user experience
- Build for scalability
- Document everything
- Test with real users
